Autonomous Claims Fraud Detection System
Overview
This project is a fully autonomous AI system designed to ingest, analyze, and generate reports on insurance claims for fraud detection. Leveraging vector search, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and AI agent orchestration, it operates end-to-end without manual intervention.

Key components include:

Email & Document Ingestion: Automatically retrieves Outlook emails and PDFs.

Excel Ground Truth Integration: Semantic comparison with existing claim datasets.

Vector Search with FAISS: Fast similarity search on textual claim data.

Autonomous Agents with MCP: AI agents coordinate to make decisions and generate insights.

Report Generation: Generates structured JSON and human-readable TXT reports.

Modern Concept Protocol (MCP)
The Modern Concept Protocol (MCP) is the backbone of autonomous decision-making in this system. It is a sophisticated framework that allows AI agents to coordinate, reason, and act without human intervention. The importance of MCP lies in its ability to transform a collection of individual AI tools into a cohesive, intelligent, and autonomous workflow.

How MCP Works in this Project
1. Agent Initialization
Each agent is responsible for a specific, well-defined task (e.g., text extraction, vectorization, similarity search, report drafting). These agents are initialized with their respective goals and capabilities.

2. Autonomous Workflow Orchestration
MCP ensures the sequential and conditional execution of agents. It manages the flow of the pipeline, ensuring that each step is completed before the next one begins. For example, text must be extracted before it can be vectorized, and vectors must be created before a similarity search can be performed. The protocol can also handle dynamic branching—for instance, if a claims email contains no attachments, MCP can instruct the system to skip the document parsing and similarity search steps.

3. Knowledge Integration
When an agent needs external information to complete a task, MCP facilitates the query. For example, the fraud analysis agent queries the vector store (populated by the FAISS index) for similar claims to identify potential fraud patterns. MCP then manages the process of merging these retrieved "ground truth" results into a coherent and insightful report.

4. Decision Logging
Every action, decision, and data flow is meticulously logged. This creates a transparent and traceable record of the entire process, which is essential for auditability. Reports generated by the system include detailed explanations for flagged claims, citing the matched ground truth and timestamps for full traceability.

5. Scalability & Extensibility
The modular nature of MCP allows for easy scalability. New agents can be added to handle new data sources (e.g., a "Social Media Agent" to search for public claim information) or additional reasoning modules with minimal changes to the core system.

Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_folder>
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
env\Scripts\activate     # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt


Configuration
Create a .env file in the project root with the following credentials to connect to your data sources and APIs:

MS_USERNAME=<your_outlook_username>
MS_PASSWORD=<your_outlook_password>
GOOGLE_API_KEY=<your_google_api_key>
CLIENT_ID=<your_microsoft_app_client_id>
CLIENT_SECRET=<your_microsoft_app_client_secret>
TENANT_ID=<your_microsoft_tenant_id>


Usage
Simply run the main script to start the autonomous pipeline:

python src/main.py


This command will:

Automatically fetch emails, PDFs, and Excel data.

Perform a vector similarity search on new claims against existing ground truth data.

Use MCP to coordinate AI reasoning and generate a fraud analysis report.

Save the reports in the reports/ folder in both TXT and JSON formats.
